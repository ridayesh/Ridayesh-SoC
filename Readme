Hey there! This is my project Repo for Rendering a planet with atmospheric light scaterring using various shaders in OpenGL. I implemented it in my 1st year
for fun and to be productive. Use WASD to move around, mouse to look here and there. Use C and V to move up and down. Enjoy! :)

There are instructions on how to run this on Windows Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

Thanks!
